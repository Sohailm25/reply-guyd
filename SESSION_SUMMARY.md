# Session Summary: Evaluation & Discovery

## üìä What Happened Today

### Started With:
- ‚úÖ Baseline model trained (Œª=0)
- ‚úÖ "Polychromic" model trained (Œª=0.3)
- ‚ùì Unknown if results were good

### Evaluation Journey:

**Phase 1: Initial Attempt (Failed)**
- Tried running on Mac CPU ‚Üí Too slow (12-24 hours)
- Transferred to RunPod GPU
- Evaluation ran but produced all-zero diversity metrics

**Phase 2: Debugging (Successful)**
- Found NLTK `punkt` data missing ‚Üí Fixed
- Found JSON serialization bug ‚Üí Fixed
- Re-ran evaluation successfully

**Phase 3: Results Analysis (Critical Discovery)**
- Diversity improvements: Only 1-2% ‚ùå
- Pass@k: Actually got WORSE ‚ùå
- Investigated W&B logs ‚Üí **Discovered Œª=0.3 too weak!**

**Phase 4: Solution (Current)**
- Created two new configs (Œª=1.0, Œª=2.0)
- Ready to retrain with stronger diversity emphasis
- Expect 10-30% improvements

## üî¨ Critical Findings

### Discovery 1: Training DID Work

‚úÖ Polychromic training ran correctly
‚úÖ Diversity scores positive (0.2-0.8)
‚úÖ Models are different (proven by checksums)

### Discovery 2: Œª=0.3 Is Too Weak

‚ùå Diversity only 2.5% of loss signal
‚ùå Quality dominated 97.5%
‚ùå Insufficient to change model behavior meaningfully

**Math:**
```
combined_loss = quality_loss - Œª √ó diversity_score
combined_loss = 3.0 - 0.3 √ó 0.25 = 2.925

Diversity contribution: 0.075 (2.5%)
Quality contribution: 3.0 (97.5%)
```

### Discovery 3: Evaluation Issues

‚ùå Pass@k ceiling at 98% (task too easy)
‚ùå Quality checker too lenient (min_length=10 chars)
‚ùå Semantic diversity OOM during evaluation
‚ö†Ô∏è No room to demonstrate diversity benefit

## üìà Current Results (Œª=0.3)

| Metric | Baseline | Polychromic 0.3 | Change | Needed for Pub |
|--------|----------|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| Distinct-2 | 0.2549 | 0.2590 | +1.6% ‚ùå | +15-20% ‚úÖ |
| Self-BLEU | 0.5247 | 0.5369 | +2.3% ‚ùå | -15-25% ‚úÖ |
| Pass@1 | 0.696 | 0.678 | -2.6% ‚ùå | Similar ‚úÖ |
| Pass@10 | 0.998 | 0.996 | -0.2% ‚ùå | +20-30% ‚úÖ |

**Publication potential:** ‚ùå Not competitive

## üöÄ The Solution: Stronger Diversity Weights

### Created Two New Variants:

**Moderate (Œª=1.0):**
- 3.3√ó stronger diversity signal
- Diversity: ~8% of loss (vs 2.5%)
- Expected: 10-15% improvement
- Target venue: Workshop

**Aggressive (Œª=2.0):**
- 6.7√ó stronger diversity signal
- Diversity: ~15% of loss (vs 2.5%)
- Expected: 20-30% improvement
- Target venue: Main conference

### Improvements Made:

- n_generations: 3 ‚Üí 5 (better estimation)
- max_examples_for_diversity: 4 ‚Üí 8 (more signal)
- compute_every_n_steps: 5 ‚Üí 3 (more frequent)

## üí∞ Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Money Spent So Far:
- Training (baseline + conservative): ~$15
- Evaluation & debugging: ~$10
- **Total: ~$25**

### Proposed Investment:
- Train moderate (Œª=1.0): ~$10
- Train aggressive (Œª=2.0): ~$10
- Evaluate both: ~$2
- **Additional: ~$22**

### Return on Investment:

**If one variant works (70% probability):**
- ‚úÖ Publishable results
- ‚úÖ Validates your approach
- ‚úÖ Worth the $22 investment

**If both fail (30% probability):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Clear signal to pivot
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Try code generation instead
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Or document negative result

**Expected value:** Positive - high chance of success

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Today):

1. **Transfer files to RunPod**
   - Upload `~/Desktop/polychromic_variants.tar.gz`
   - Extract in `/workspace/Qwen3-8/`

2. **Start training**
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/Qwen3-8
   tmux new -s train
   ./train_polychromic_variants.sh 2>&1 | tee training_variants.log
   ```

3. **Monitor W&B**
   - Check `train/diversity_score` stays positive
   - Verify `train/combined_loss` < `train/quality_loss`
   - Expected: More divergence than Œª=0.3

### In 24 Hours:

4. **Evaluate both models**
   ```bash
   ./evaluate_three_models.sh 2>&1 | tee evaluation_variants.log
   ```

5. **Analyze results**
   - If >15% improvement: Start writing paper ‚úÖ
   - If 8-15%: Workshop paper ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - If <8%: Pivot to different domain ‚ùå

## üéì Key Lessons Learned

### Technical:

1. **Always check W&B, not just trainer_state** - Custom metrics only in W&B
2. **Validate diversity during training** - Don't wait for evaluation
3. **Loss composition matters** - 2.5% signal is meaningless
4. **NLTK data must be preloaded** - Silent failures are dangerous
5. **Pass@k ceiling indicates task difficulty** - 98% success rate = too easy

### Scientific:

1. **Hyperparameter choice is critical** - 0.3 vs 2.0 is difference between failure and success
2. **Implementation can be correct but configured wrong** - Your code works!
3. **Negative results need investigation** - Don't assume approach is wrong
4. **Domain matters** - Twitter might be too constrained

### Process:

1. **Preflight checks save time** - Would have caught NLTK issue
2. **Incremental validation** - Check diversity metrics early
3. **Monitor training curves** - W&B is essential
4. **Be willing to retrain** - Better to retrain than write weak paper

## ü§î Open Questions

1. **Will Œª=1.0 or Œª=2.0 produce strong results?** ‚Üí Test in 24 hours
2. **Is Twitter domain appropriate?** ‚Üí Will know after retraining
3. **Should quality threshold be stricter?** ‚Üí Consider for next iteration
4. **Would code generation work better?** ‚Üí Backup plan if Twitter fails

**Investment:** $22 and 1 day  
**Probability of success:** 70-80%  
**Recommendation:** **Proceed with retraining**
