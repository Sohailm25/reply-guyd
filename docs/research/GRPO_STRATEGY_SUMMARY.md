# üéØ GRPO Strategy: Executive Summary

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Purpose:** High-level overview of GRPO implementation strategy  
**Audience:** Quick decision-making reference

---

## üîë Key Insight

Your curated dataset with engagement metrics (likes, retweets) IS the reward signal you need for GRPO. You don't need to build this from scratch‚Äîyou've already collected it!

**What you have:**
```python
{
  "tweet": "AI will change healthcare",
  "reply": "Absolutely! Early disease detection could save millions...",
  "reply_likes": 50,        # ‚Üê This is your reward signal!
  "tweet_likes": 500,       # ‚Üê Context for normalization
  "reply_retweets": 5,      # ‚Üê Additional signal
  "reply_author_followers": 5000,  # ‚Üê Credibility context
  "reply_time_diff_seconds": 1800  # ‚Üê Timing advantage
}
```

## üìä Three Training Paradigms Compared

### Current: Supervised + Polychromic
```python
L = L_quality - Œª * D(generations)
```

**What it does:**
- Matches high-quality reference replies (supervised)
- Generates diverse alternatives (polychromic)

**Limitation:**
- Bounded by reference quality
- Can't optimize directly for engagement

**Results:**
- Pass@1 = 0.40, Pass@10 = 0.61

---

### Proposed: + GRPO
```python
L = -Œ£(log_prob * advantage) + Œ≤ * KL_penalty
```

**What it adds:**
- Learns from relative quality rankings
- Optimizes for predicted engagement
- Not bounded by references

**Advantage:**
- Can discover strategies beyond training data
- Directly maximizes engagement metric

**Expected:**
- Pass@1 = 0.38, Pass@10 = 0.72

---

### Hybrid: Best of All Worlds
```python
L = Œ±*L_supervised + Œ≤*L_grpo - Œª*D(generations)
```

**What it combines:**
- Quality baseline (supervised, Œ±=0.3)
- Engagement optimization (GRPO, Œ≤=0.5)
- Diversity maintenance (polychromic, Œª=0.2)

**Stability:**
- Supervised component prevents reward hacking
- GRPO pushes beyond references
- Diversity prevents mode collapse

**Expected:**
- Pass@1 = 0.45, Pass@10 = 0.75 ‚ú®

---

## üéØ Recommendation: Phased Approach

### Phase 1: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Supervised baseline
- [x] Polychromic training
- [x] Initial evaluation
- **Status:** Models trained, ready for Phase 2

### Phase 2: Reward Model (1 week)

**Option A: Quick Start (2 days)**
- Heuristic reward function
- Zero training cost
- Good for validation

**Option B: Robust (1 week)** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
- Train engagement predictor on your 5,000 pairs
- Input: (tweet, reply) ‚Üí Output: engagement score [0,1]
- 2 hours training on A40 ($2)

**Decision:** Start with A, upgrade to B if results promising

### Phase 3: GRPO Training (1-2 weeks)

**Implementation:**
1. Create GRPOTrainer class (3-4 days)
2. Test on small dataset (1 day)
3. Full training (16-20 hours GPU, $13)
4. Evaluation (2-3 hours)

**Expected:** Pass@10 improves by 10-15%

### Phase 4 (Optional): Hybrid (1 week)

If GRPO works but loses some quality:
- Implement HybridTrainer
- Combines all three loss components
- Most novel contribution
- Best paper results

|--------|----------|-------------|------|--------|
| **Pass@1** | 0.42 | 0.40 | 0.38 | **0.45** |
| **Pass@5** | 0.42 | 0.55 | 0.63 | **0.68** |

## üîß Technical Requirements

### New Files Needed

```
src/training/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reward_model.py        # 300 lines
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ heuristic_reward.py    # 150 lines
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grpo_trainer.py        # 400 lines
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hybrid_trainer.py      # 250 lines (optional)

scripts/training/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train_reward_model.py  # 200 lines
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validate_reward_model.py  # 100 lines

config/experiments/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grpo.yaml             # 50 lines
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hybrid.yaml           # 50 lines (optional)
```

**Total new code:** ~1,500 lines  
**Time to implement:** 5-7 days for experienced developer

### Modifications to Existing Code

Minimal! Your existing infrastructure is well-designed:

```python
# scripts/training/train_model.py
# Add GRPO support (20 lines)

if config.training.get('use_grpo', False):
    trainer = GRPOTrainer(...)
else:
    trainer = PolychromicTrainer(...) or Trainer(...)
```

**Your polychromic trainer, evaluation suite, and data module can be reused as-is!**

## üö® Key Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Reward Hacking
**Problem:** Model exploits reward function rather than improving quality  
**Example:** All replies become "Agreed!" (high score, low quality)

**Mitigation:**
- Use hybrid training (supervised anchors to ground truth)
- Ensemble reward (multiple validation signals)
- Manual inspection regularly
- KL penalty (stay close to reference)

### Risk 2: Training Instability
**Problem:** Policy gradients high-variance, loss jumps around

**Mitigation:**
- Smaller learning rate (1e-5 vs 2e-4)
- Clip advantages (-10, +10)
- More gradient accumulation (8 vs 4)
- Save checkpoints frequently

### Risk 3: No Improvement Over Polychromic
**Problem:** GRPO doesn't outperform polychromic baseline

**Mitigation:**
- Validate reward model first (correlation > 0.5)
- Start with heuristic reward (simpler)
- Check KL penalty (if too high, model can't explore)
- Increase n_generations or temperature

### Risk 4: Computational Cost
**Problem:** GRPO is 4-5x slower than baseline

**Mitigation:**
- Reduce K (4 ‚Üí 3 generations): 25% faster
- Compute GRPO every 2 steps: 50% faster
- Use gradient checkpointing
- Flash Attention (already implemented!)

**With optimizations:** 12-16 hours instead of 20 hours

## üéì Why This Strategy is Optimal

### 1. Leverages Your Unique Data
Most GRPO implementations struggle to get reward signals. You have:
- 5,000+ curated examples
- Real engagement metrics
- Rich context (timing, credibility, popularity)

**This is a massive advantage!**

### 2. Builds on Strong Foundation
Your existing infrastructure:
- Polychromic trainer (diversity generation)
- Evaluation suite (Pass@k, diversity, quality)
- Data module (stratified splits)

**All reusable for GRPO!**

### 3. Minimizes Risk
Phased approach:
1. Heuristic reward (zero risk)
2. Learned reward (low risk, validated)
3. GRPO training (medium risk, checkpoint frequently)
4. Hybrid (optional, if results warrant)

**Can stop at any phase if results sufficient!**

### 4. Novel Contribution
Combining supervised + polychromic + GRPO:
- Not done before (to our knowledge)
- Addresses complementary aspects
- Strong paper angle

**Unique selling point for publication!**

### 5. Practical Timeline
- Week 1: Reward model (safe, can validate early)
- Week 2: GRPO (core contribution)
- Week 3: Evaluation (know if it works)
- Week 4+: Iterate or proceed to multi-seed

**Fits academic timeline, clear milestones!**
