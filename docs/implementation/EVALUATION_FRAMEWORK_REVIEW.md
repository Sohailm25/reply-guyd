# 🔍 Evaluation Framework Review

Based on best practices for evaluating fine-tuned models, here's what we have vs. what we need:

---

## ✅ What We HAVE Implemented

### 1. **Test Set Creation** ✅
**Location:** `src/training/data_module.py`
- ✅ Automatic train/val/test split (80/10/10)
- ✅ Stratified sampling by engagement quartiles
- ✅ Consistent random seed (42)
- ✅ Proper holdout set that model never sees

```python
# Lines 234-253 in data_module.py
train_df, temp_df = train_test_split(
    df,
    test_size=(self.val_split + self.test_split),
    stratify=df['engagement_quartile'],
    random_state=self.random_seed  # ✅ Fixed seed
)
```

### 2. **Consistent Prompts** ✅
**Location:** `src/evaluation/prompt_templates.py`
- ✅ Modular prompt templates
- ✅ Same prompts used across all baselines
- ✅ Clear separation between zero-shot/few-shot/engineered

**Key principle followed:**
> "Fine-tuning should make the model perform better *with the same prompts*"

### 3. **Four-Baseline Comparison** ✅
**Location:** `scripts/evaluation/evaluate_comprehensive.py`
- ✅ Zero-shot (simple prompt)
- ✅ Few-shot (with examples)
- ✅ Standard LoRA
- ✅ Polychromic LoRA

All use **same test set** and **same evaluation metrics**.

### 4. **Quantitative Metrics** ✅
**Implemented:**
- ✅ **Diversity:** Self-BLEU, Distinct-n, Semantic diversity
- ✅ **Quality:** ROUGE-L, BERTScore
- ✅ **Pass@k:** Our primary metric (1, 3, 5, 10)
- ✅ **Statistical tests:** Mann-Whitney U, Cohen's d, bootstrap CI

### 5. **Prompt Strategy Alignment** ✅
**Good practices we follow:**
- ✅ Fine-tuned models use simple prompts during training
- ✅ Test prompts match training format
- ✅ Don't over-engineer prompts for fine-tuned models
- ✅ Prompt-engineered baseline shows what prompting alone can achieve

## ⚠️ What Needs IMPROVEMENT

### 1. **Temperature Control for Determinism** ⚠️

**Current State:**
```python
# evaluate_comprehensive.py line 128, 161
temperature=0.7  # ❌ NON-DETERMINISTIC
do_sample=True
```

**Problem:**
- Temperature=0.7 introduces randomness
- Makes metrics non-reproducible
- Can't directly compare runs without averaging

**Best Practice Violation:**
> "Set temperature=0 (or very low) for deterministic outputs"

**Solution Needed:**
1. **For single-generation metrics** (ROUGE, BERTScore):
   - Use `temperature=0` or greedy decoding
   - OR run 3-5 times and average

2. **For Pass@k evaluation** (our focus):
   - Keep `temperature=0.7` to generate diverse candidates
   - This is correct! Pass@k needs diversity

3. **Separate evaluation modes:**
   ```python
   # Mode 1: Deterministic quality evaluation
   generate_replies(..., temperature=0, do_sample=False)  # For ROUGE, etc.
   
   # Mode 2: Diverse candidate generation
   generate_replies(..., temperature=0.7, do_sample=True)  # For Pass@k
   ```

### 2. **Multiple Seeds/Runs** ⚠️

**Current State:**
```yaml
# All configs use single seed
random_seed: 42
```

**Problem:**
- No variance estimation across random initializations
- Can't claim statistical robustness

**Best Practice:**
> "Run 3-5 random seeds per configuration"

**Solution Needed:**
1. Create config variants:
   ```
   config/experiments/baseline_seed42.yaml
   config/experiments/baseline_seed123.yaml
   config/experiments/baseline_seed456.yaml
   ```

2. Add seed loop to evaluation:
   ```python
   for seed in [42, 123, 456]:
       train_model(config, seed=seed)
       evaluate_model(model, seed=seed)
   
   # Then aggregate results
   compute_mean_and_std_across_seeds()
   ```

### 3. **LLM-as-Judge Temperature** ⚠️

**Current State:**
```python
# src/evaluation/llm_judge.py line 194
temperature=0.7  # ❌ Not aligned with research
```

**Problem:**
According to recent research (arXiv:2412.12509):
> "Fixed randomness at temperature=0 does NOT guarantee reliability—you must use multiple samples and averaging even at low temperatures"

**Solution Needed:**
- Use low temperature (0.3) but run multiple evaluations
- OR keep 0.7 but average over 3-5 samples
- Already using position bias mitigation ✅

### 4. **Prompt Used During Training** ⚠️

**Current State:**
```python
# src/training/data_module.py line 78
"Generate an engaging Twitter reply to this tweet:\n\n{example.tweet}\n\nReply:"
```

**Good:** Simple and consistent ✅

**Potential Issue:**
- This prompt is hardcoded in training
- Should match what we use for evaluation

**Verification Needed:**
Check if evaluation uses exact same prompt format for fine-tuned models.

### 5. **Documentation of Evaluation Strategy** ⚠️

**Missing:**
- No clear documentation explaining:
  - Why we use temperature=0.7 for Pass@k but should use 0 for quality metrics
  - Multiple runs strategy
  - How prompts are consistent across baselines

## 🎯 Recommended Changes (Priority Order)

### **Priority 1: Temperature Strategy** 🔴
**Impact:** HIGH - Affects reproducibility and fair comparison

**Change Needed:**
```python
# scripts/evaluation/evaluate_comprehensive.py

def evaluate_single_generation_quality(model, test_data):
    """For ROUGE, BERTScore - needs determinism."""
    return generate_replies(
        model, 
        test_data,
        temperature=0.0,  # ← CHANGE THIS
        do_sample=False,   # ← ADD THIS
        n_per_prompt=1     # Single generation
    )

def evaluate_passk_performance(model, test_data):
    """For Pass@k - needs diversity."""
    return generate_replies(
        model,
        test_data, 
        temperature=0.7,   # ← KEEP THIS
        do_sample=True,
        n_per_prompt=10    # Multiple candidates
    )
```

### **Priority 2: Multi-Seed Training** 🟡
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Needed for statistical robustness

**Change Needed:**
1. Create seed configs:
   ```bash
   # For each experiment
   cp baseline.yaml baseline_seed42.yaml
   cp baseline.yaml baseline_seed123.yaml
   cp baseline.yaml baseline_seed456.yaml
   # Update random_seed in each
   ```

2. Add seed aggregation script:
   ```python
   # scripts/analysis/aggregate_seeds.py
   def aggregate_across_seeds(results_dir):
       # Load results from seed_42, seed_123, seed_456
       # Compute mean ± std for all metrics
       # Report in paper as: "Pass@10: 0.78 ± 0.03"
   ```

3. Update training workflow:
   ```bash
   # Train all seeds
   for seed in 42 123 456; do
       python scripts/training/train_model.py \
           --config config/experiments/baseline_seed${seed}.yaml
   done
   ```

### **Priority 3: Prompt Consistency Check** 🟢
**Impact:** LOW - Likely already correct, just needs verification

**Verification Needed:**
```bash
# Check if training prompt matches evaluation prompt
grep -n "Generate an engaging Twitter reply" src/training/data_module.py
grep -n "Generate an engaging Twitter reply" scripts/evaluation/evaluate_comprehensive.py
```

If different → Update evaluation to match training exactly.

### **Priority 4: Documentation** 🟢
**Impact:** LOW - Doesn't affect results, but clarifies methodology

**Add to docs:**
- `docs/implementation/EVALUATION_STRATEGY.md`
- Explain temperature choices
- Document multi-seed approach
- Clarify why fine-tuning reduces need for prompt engineering

## 💡 Key Insight

**You asked:**
> "Am I supposed to engineer prompts perfectly for comparison?"

**Answer:** NO! ✅ You're doing it RIGHT!

Your approach:
- Fine-tuned models: Simple prompts ✅
- Prompt-engineered baseline: Shows what prompting alone can do ✅
- Same prompts across all models ✅

**The point:** Fine-tuning should make the model perform better with *simpler* prompts than prompt engineering alone. Your setup correctly tests this!

**Only fix needed:** Add deterministic mode for quality metrics (temp=0) while keeping temp=0.7 for Pass@k.
