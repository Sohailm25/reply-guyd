# üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION: Data Recovery

## üîç What We Just Discovered

**Your "lost" 1,713 pairs might be recoverable!**

Apify stores the raw tweet data from each actor run in their cloud storage. Even though our local checkpoint file was overwritten, we can fetch the original tweets from Apify.

---

## ‚ö° Run This Command NOW

```bash
./run.sh python scripts/recovery/recover_apify_data.py --start-time "2025-10-02 09:10:00"
```

**What this does:**
- Connects to Apify's API
- Lists all actor runs since 9:10 AM CST today
- Fetches the datasets from each run
- Shows you how many tweets are recoverable
- Saves recovered tweets to `data/recovered/`

**Time:** ~2-5 minutes  
**Cost:** FREE (just retrieving data we already paid for)

---

## üìä What to Expect

### Good Scenario
```
Found 6 runs in the last 12 hours
Total unique tweets: 1,150
‚úÖ Saved to: data/recovered/recovered_tweets_20251002_162800.jsonl
```

**This means:** We can recover ~1,150 main tweets from Queries 1-6!

### Challenge
- Apify stores the MAIN TWEETS (what we searched for)
- Apify does NOT store the REPLIES (those were fetched separately)
- To get the full tweet-reply pairs back, we'd need to re-fetch replies

---

## üí∞ Recovery Cost Analysis

### Option A: Just Recover Tweets (FREE)
- Get back ~1,000-1,500 tweets from Queries 1-6
- No replies, just the main tweets
- **Cost: $0**
- **Value: Limited** (we need replies for training)

### Option B: Recover + Re-fetch Replies (~$15-20)
- Get back ~1,000-1,500 tweets
- Re-fetch current replies for each tweet
- Create ~1,500 tweet-reply pairs
- **Cost: ~$15-20**
- **Value: High** (recovers your "lost" data)

### Option C: Fresh Collection (~$40)
- Start completely fresh with fixed system
- Collect 2,000 clean pairs
- **Cost: ~$40**
- **Value: Highest** (new data, no bugs)

### Option D: Both (~$55-60)
- Recover old data (~$20 to re-fetch replies)
- Collect fresh data (~$40)
- Get ~3,500+ total pairs!
- **Cost: ~$55-60**
- **Value: Best** (maximum dataset size)

## üéØ Recommended Path

### Step 1: Evaluate (5 minutes, FREE)

```bash
./run.sh python scripts/recovery/recover_apify_data.py --start-time "2025-10-02 09:10:00"
```

### Step 2: Check Results

```bash
# How many tweets did we recover?
wc -l data/recovered/*.jsonl

# What do they look like?
head -n 3 data/recovered/*.jsonl | jq '.'
```

### Step 3: Decide Based on Count

**If recovered 1,000+ tweets:**
- ‚úÖ Worth re-fetching replies (~$20)
- Would give you ~1,500 pairs back
- Combined with current run: ~2,000+ total pairs

**If recovered 500-999 tweets:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Marginal - depends on budget
- Re-fetching replies: ~$10-15
- Might be worth it if you want maximum data

**If recovered <500 tweets:**
- ‚ùå Probably not worth it
- Just continue with fresh collection
- You'll hit 2,000 pairs in 8 hours anyway

---

## üöÄ After Running Recovery Script

### If you recovered 1,000+ tweets:

**Tell me the count and I'll create a script to:**
1. Load the recovered tweets
2. Re-fetch current replies for each
3. Apply our quality filters
4. Create the tweet-reply pairs
5. Merge with any current collection data

**This would:**
- Cost ~$15-20 (much less than original $35!)
- Give you back most of the "lost" pairs
- Take ~3-4 hours

### If you want to skip recovery:

Just let your current collection finish OR restart fresh:

**Option 1: Let current run finish**
- It will collect Queries 7-15 (~800-1000 pairs)
- Already using the fixed system

**Option 2: Restart fresh**
```bash
# Stop current collection
tmux attach -t collection-new
# Press Ctrl+C

# Clean up
rm data/raw/checkpoint*.json*

# Start fresh
./run.sh python scripts/collect_data.py --target 2000
```

---

## üìû What to Tell Me

After running the recovery command, tell me:

1. **How many runs were found?**
   ```
   Found X runs in the last 12 hours
   ```

2. **How many unique tweets?**
   ```
   Unique tweets: XXX
   ```

3. **Do you want to recover them?**
   - Yes, re-fetch replies (~$15-20)
   - No, just continue with fresh collection

**Based on that, I'll advise the best path forward!**

---

## ‚ö° TL;DR - Run This Now

```bash
# See what's recoverable (5 minutes, FREE)
./run.sh python scripts/recovery/recover_apify_data.py --start-time "2025-10-02 09:10:00"

# Then tell me the count!
wc -l data/recovered/*.jsonl
```

**Then we'll decide together if it's worth recovering!** üéØ
