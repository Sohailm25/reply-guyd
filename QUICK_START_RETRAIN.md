# Quick Start: Retrain with Stronger λ

## TL;DR

Your λ=0.3 model showed only 1-2% improvement because diversity was 2.5% of the loss signal.

**Solution:** Train with λ=1.0 and λ=2.0 to test if stronger diversity penalties work.

**Time:** 24 hours  
**Cost:** $22  
**Success probability:** 70-80%

## 🚀 Three Commands to Start

### On Mac:

```bash
# Files are ready at:
ls ~/Desktop/polychromic_variants.tar.gz
```

### On RunPod (upload tar.gz via web terminal first):

```bash
cd /workspace/Qwen3-8
tar -xzf ~/polychromic_variants.tar.gz  # wherever you uploaded it
chmod +x *.sh

# Start training in tmux
tmux new -s train
./train_polychromic_variants.sh 2>&1 | tee training.log
# Ctrl+b, d to detach
```

**That's it!** Come back in 24 hours.

## 📊 What Will Happen

### Hour 0-12: Train Moderate (λ=1.0)
```
Step 1/2: Training Moderate (λ=1.0)
- Diversity weight: 1.0 (3.3× stronger)
- Expected diversity signal: ~8% of loss
- W&B run: polychromic-1.0-moderate-seed42
```

### Hour 12-24: Train Aggressive (λ=2.0)
```
Step 2/2: Training Aggressive (λ=2.0)
- Diversity weight: 2.0 (6.7× stronger)
- Expected diversity signal: ~15% of loss
- W&B run: polychromic-2.0-aggressive-seed42
```

### After 24 Hours:
```
✓ ALL TRAINING COMPLETE!

Models available:
  output/experiments/polychromic_1.0/seed_42/
  output/experiments/polychromic_2.0/seed_42/
```

## 🔍 Monitor During Training

### Check W&B Dashboard

Go to: https://wandb.ai/your-username/qwen3-twitter-polychromic

**For MODERATE (λ=1.0), you should see:**
- `train/diversity_score`: 0.2-0.8 (positive!)
- `train/combined_loss`: ~10-15% lower than `quality_loss`
- `train/avg_unique_words`: Increasing

**For AGGRESSIVE (λ=2.0), you should see:**
- `train/diversity_score`: 0.3-0.9 (positive!)
- `train/combined_loss`: ~20-30% lower than `quality_loss`
- Larger gap between combined and quality loss

**Red flags 🚨:**
- combined_loss > quality_loss (diversity is negative!)
- diversity_score drops to 0
- Training crashes with OOM

---

## ✅ After Training: Evaluate

### Run Evaluation (2-3 hours):

```bash
cd /workspace/Qwen3-8
tmux new -s eval
./evaluate_three_models.sh 2>&1 | tee evaluation.log
# Ctrl+b, d
```

### Check Results:

```bash
# View summary
cat output/evaluation/baseline_vs_moderate/summary.json | jq '.diversity'
cat output/evaluation/baseline_vs_aggressive/summary.json | jq '.diversity'
```

**Decision criteria:**

| Improvement | Verdict | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| >25% | ✅✅ Excellent | Submit to EMNLP main track |
| 15-25% | ✅ Good | Submit to workshop |
| 8-15% | ⚠️ Marginal | arXiv or keep iterating |
| <8% | ❌ Weak | Pivot to code generation |

## 💡 What Each Scenario Means

### Best Case: Aggressive (λ=2.0) Shows 25-35% Improvement

**Publication:**
- Main conference track (EMNLP, ACL)
- 4 figures, 5 novel contributions
- Strong empirical results

**Timeline:**
- Evaluation: 2-3 days
- Paper writing: 3-4 weeks
- Submission: Ready for next deadline

### Good Case: Moderate (λ=1.0) Shows 15-20% Improvement

**Publication:**
- Workshop or findings track
- Solid contribution, not groundbreaking
- Still publishable

**Timeline:**
- Evaluation: 2-3 days
- Paper writing: 2-3 weeks
- Target workshop deadlines

### Okay Case: 8-15% Improvement

**Publication:**
- arXiv technical report
- Blog post
- Not competitive for peer review

**Decision:**
- Try λ=3.0 or λ=5.0
- Or pivot to code generation
- Or combine with GRPO

### Worst Case: <8% Improvement

**Publication:**
- Negative result (still valuable!)
- arXiv: "Why diversity-aware training doesn't help Twitter"

**Decision:**
- ❌ Abandon Twitter domain
- ✅ Pivot to code generation (HumanEval)
- ✅ Use exact same infrastructure

## 🎯 Your Decision

**Option A: Retrain with stronger λ (Recommended)**
- Cost: $22
- Time: 24 hours
- Success probability: 70-80%
- Clear answer about viability

**Option B: Pivot to code generation now**
- Cost: $15-20
- Time: ~15 hours
- Success probability: 80-90%
- Different domain, same infrastructure

**Option C: Stop and document negative result**
- Cost: $0
- Time: 1-2 weeks writing
- Publish as technical report

---

## 🤔 My Recommendation

**Retrain with λ=1.0 and λ=2.0** (Option A)

**Why:**
1. You're 80% there - implementation works!
2. Only hyperparameter needs adjustment
3. $22 is cheap for clarity
4. If it works → Full paper
5. If it fails → Clear pivot decision

**If you don't retrain:**
- You'll always wonder "what if λ=2.0 worked?"
- $25 already spent without answer
- Sunk cost with no conclusion
